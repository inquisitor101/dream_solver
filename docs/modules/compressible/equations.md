The fundamental equations describing the motion of an unsteady, viscous and compressible flow in a space-time cylinder
$\Omega \times (0, t_{end}] \in \mathbb{R}^{d+1}$ with non-empty bounded $d$-dimensional spatial domain $\Omega$, with
boundary $\partial \Omega$, and final time $t_{end}$, are specified by the Navier-Stokes equations. In terms of
conservative variables, $\vec{U} = \begin{pmatrix} \rho, & \rho \vec{u}, & \rho E \end{pmatrix}^\T$, with density $\rho$, velocity $\vec{u}$, and total specific energy $E$,
this system can be expressed in dimensionless form as
